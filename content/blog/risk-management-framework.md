The most consistent traders in Dalal Street obsess about risk first, returns later. Here is a robust framework to adapt today.

### 1. Capital Allocation Rules

- Park long-term allocation in low-volatility instruments.
- Use a dedicated trading treasury with defined max exposure per strategy.
- Rebalance profits monthly; withdraw excess to lock gains.

### 2. Position Sizing Matrix

| Setup Quality | Risk per Trade |
| --- | --- |
| A+ (High Conviction) | 1.5% of equity |
| A (Strong) | 1% of equity |
| B (Prob with data) | 0.5% of equity |

### 3. Scenario Hedging

- Use protective puts for swing trades ahead of macro events.
- For intraday, hedge index futures with far OTM options to cover tail risk.

### 4. Quant Alerts

- Track portfolio VAR, drawdown, and streaks using Python or Google Sheets.
- Get SMS/email alerts when drawdown exceeds 6% or when exposure crosses thresholds.

Risk management is not just mathâ€”it's a mindset. Automate guardrails so you execute with clarity even on volatile days.
